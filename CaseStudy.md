## Hut 8 Mining
----------

### What is it?
 
Hut 8 Mining is a Canadian company that focuses on the mining of bitcoin. The company is named after the building where Alan Turing created the foundation of Blockchain in WWII. They are the largest miner of bitcoin in the world, making them the leading competitor in its domain. Other Canadian cryptocurrency mining companies pale in comparison when it comes to computing power and processing capacity. Not only that, but Hut 8 is the first issuer to be listed in the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). 
 
Hut 8â€™s headquarters are in Toronto, Canada, but their operations all take place in Alberta, Canada. This is unlike some of their bigger competitors, Hive and Bitfarms, who have set up operations in Quebec, which has been considered the ideal place in Canada. Regardless, the company has 94 data centres spread out over the province of Alberta. They focus on reducing their resource and energy use to minimize costs of mining and increase value for investors. As Hut 8 mining grows, they plan on using more renewable energy in addition to their high efficiency chips to run their operations.

 
By utilizing the best hardware and software, Hut 8 Mining have found a way to optimize bitcoin mining. Not only does Hut 8 maximize value for investors, they provide an easy and safe way for them to invest. Hut 8 Mining removes the need for investors to send money abroad or create an online wallet in order to secure their bitcoins. 
 
Hut 8 Mining, like other companies in the mining domain, makes the idea of blockchain possible. Not to mention that mining is necessary to allow people to access blockchain. However, what is interesting about Hut 8 Mining is that through their efforts, they focus on coming up with sustainable, but low cost, ways to continue bitcoin mining so as to reduce the environmental impact of operations while still providing maximum value.

### Why this matters?
 
Canada has become a desired location for crypto-currency miners. This is because the low electricity costs, minimal regulations, and cold are ideal for running these energy intensive operations. It is estimated that the electricity used for one bitcoin transaction alone is more than that utilized by a Canadian household on a monthly basis. The energy needs of this domain are thus, a challenge for many. However, by utilizing the best hardware and software and focusing on sustainable energy sources, Hut 8 Mining have found a way to optimize bitcoin mining.
